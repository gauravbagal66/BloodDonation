# BloodDonation
This Blood Donation Project is an open-source initiative aimed at facilitating blood donation processes and improving accessibility to blood for patients in need. This platform serves as a bridge between blood donors and recipients, making it easier for hospitals, clinics, and individuals to find and connect with potential donors.
